Notes on Smart Contract Programming Workshop

Context:
October 10, and November 10
Iâ€™m from UMD. These course materials have been built with help from others at UMD, Kevin, Mitchell, Ahmed, and Elaine Shi. We will put our notes up here. This event is currently part of any research study (though that would be a good idea for the future).
